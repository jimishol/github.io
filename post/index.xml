      <title>As a Book for bridge card game</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Once in a blue moon an idea sweeps through the bridge world and revolutionises thinking. The so-called Law of Total Tricks is so accurate in assessing potential in the contested auction and so easy to use (meaning in the book) that it is being introduced early and used to justify many subsequent bidding decisions.&amp;rdquo;
From the book &amp;ldquo;Understanding the contested auction&amp;rdquo; of Ron Klinger and Andrew Kambites.
Once upon a time, I was playing bridge.</description>

      <title>A Dark Ananke theme</title>
      <link>https://jimishol.github.io/post/dark_theme/</link>

      <description>All necessary files are copied from ananke/layout folder to corresponding project&amp;rsquo;s/layout folder and modified there. So, in order to have a dark theme, copy the below files. (Delete extention .txt, if you directly copy them.) You do not have to modify them.
project&amp;rsquo;s/layout/index.html. project&amp;rsquo;s/layout/_default/list.html. project&amp;rsquo;s/layout/_default/summary-with-image.html. project&amp;rsquo;s/layout/_default/summary.html. project&amp;rsquo;s/layout/_default/taxonomy.html. project&amp;rsquo;s/layout/post/list.html. project&amp;rsquo;s/layout/post/summary.html. Last, make sure your config.toml has the following color parameters you like
[params] text_color = &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; background_color_class = &amp;#34;bg-black&amp;#34; body_classes = &amp;#34;avenir bg-black&amp;#34; aux_text_color = &amp;#34;silver&amp;#34; bg_button_color = &amp;#34;bg-black&amp;#34; bg_button_hover_color = &amp;#34;hover-bg-dark-gray&amp;#34; I picked color names from here.</description>

      <title>Stockfish Chess Engine Server</title>

      <description>For linux users it seems pretty easy and natural to let scid chess databases, on low CPU and RAM devices, to use stockfish chess engine that runs on a more powerful server.
We start by installing stockfish onto our most powerful machine.
In my case a desktop with 32G RAM and 8 CPU cores with 2 threads per core, that means 16 threads.
Stockfish server The chess engine will run only when the user is logged in.</description>

      <title>Video game Pioneer analysis</title>

      <description>Years ago, got nostalgic for the time of youth and searched an old video game Elite I played on ZX Spectrum. Got upon pioneer. I loved it and tried to help in order for players to have stronger feeling of progress. I did a lengthy analysis in a relevant repository. The main idea was finally accepted, but the consequence to control the progress of player was still to come. I do not play the game any more but one great feature it has, is that supports mod.</description>

      <title>The polyhedron with the minimum of vertices, which considers itself a doughnut</title>

      <description>Paper cut unfold of a Császár polyhedron It is called Császár polyhedron
(Its dual is the Szilassi polyhedron).
Tutorial I was never able to construct Szilassi by myself, but there it follows how i constructed Császár polyhedron.
Algebraic start The Euler characteristic X of a torus is zero.
So our torus has V-E+F=0, where V=vertices, E=edges and F=faces.
We can assume all faces are triangles. So, E=3F/2 (cause with 3F we count each edge twice).</description>
